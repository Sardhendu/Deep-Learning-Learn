# Deep-Neural-Nets- Applications
Deep Neural Networks


The repository contains implementation of small application pertaining to Deep-Neural networks. Application such as 
	1. Mnist hand-written alphabet recognizer using Neural-nets
	2. Predicting next term in the sequence using RNN’s and Vanila Neural-Nets.
	

The application built are as a result of the lessons on Neural-Nets taken from Coursera by Prof. Geoffrey Hinton and lessons on Deep-Learning taken from Udacity sponsored by Google. Some part of the code for MNIST image classification - Data Cleaning, are taken from Udacity’s deep learning assignments.
